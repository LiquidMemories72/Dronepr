Gesture detection-
Point index finger to directions for detections.
Close your fist for landing.
Make an OK sign touching your thumb and index finger to do a flip.
Press d to enter draw mode and trace out the shape you want the drone to follow.
Press e to execute the shape. A new window will open and show the drone's path.
Press d again to exit drawing mode and press d once more to start a new drawing if you messed up previously.
Gesture detection and drawing still being worked on for better experience.
Thanks!
